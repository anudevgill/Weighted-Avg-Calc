Pseudocode:

START program
BUILD variables needed for program
BUILD 8 int[] arrays that contain the Knowledge and Understanding, Thinking, Communication, and Application weightings for each course in that order 
WELCOME user
EXPLAIN the program to the user
ASK user to input which course they would like to calculate a weighted average for
OBTAIN user's input for course choice
STORE user's input for course choice in variable int courseChoice
LOOP 4 times, and
    IF looping for the first time, then
        ASK user to enter their Knowledge and Understanding mark or -1 if the category was absent from the assessment
    ELSE IF looping for the second time, then 
        ASK user to enter their Thinking mark or -1 if the category was absent from the assessment
    ELSE IF looping for the third time, then
        ASK user to enter their Communication mark or -1 if the category was absent from the assessment
    ELSE IF looping for the fourth time, then
        ASK user to enter their Application mark or -1 if the category was absent from the assessment
    OBTAIN user's input for their mark
    STORE user's input for mark in a double[] array called inputMarks at index i, where i corresponds to the loop number
